## Common Issues & Fixes

### 1. `docker: No such image: cloud-harness-executor:local`
**Cause:** Local executor image was pruned by a host Docker cleanup or never built.
**Fix:** Rebuild the image from the project root:
```bash
docker compose --profile images build executor-image
```

---

### 2. `repository clone failed: unauthorized`
**Cause:** Attempting to clone a private repository without a valid GitHub App installation.
**Fix:**
1. Open the Operator Dashboard → **GitHub**.
2. Click **Install GitHub App** and authorize the target repository.
3. Ensure the repository URL matches the format `https://github.com/owner/repo.git`.

---

### 3. `workspace expired: TTL exceeded`
**Cause:** The workspace reached its 15-minute wall-clock limit or 5-minute idle limit.
**Fix:** Workspaces are ephemeral by design. Re-open a workspace using `workspace_open` with a fresh idempotency key.

---

### 4. API Key Denied (`401 Unauthorized`)
**Cause:** Expired key, revoked key, or key used against the Managed OAuth URL instead of the gateway.
**Fix:**
- Ensure the client URL is `https://api.harness.zuey.me/mcp` (NOT `https://harness.zuey.me/mcp`).
- Verify key validity in the Dashboard under **API Keys**.

---

### 5. OAuth DCR Error (`redirect_uri is not allowed by the account configuration`)
**Cause:** Cloudflare Access Managed OAuth rejected Dynamic Client Registration because the client's callback URL was not allowlisted.
**Fix:**
1. Log into [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) → **Access controls** → **Applications**.
2. Edit the application for your MCP hostname → **Advanced settings** → **Managed OAuth**.
3. Add the required callback URLs to **Allowed redirect URIs**:
   - **Claude Desktop:** `https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback` and `https://claude.com/api/mcp/auth_callback`
   - **Codex App / Native Clients:** Pin `mcp_oauth_callback_port = 3118` in `~/.codex/config.toml` and add `http://127.0.0.1:3118/callback/*`, `http://127.0.0.1:3118/*`, `http://localhost:3118/callback/*`, and `http://localhost:3118/*`.
   - **ChatGPT Web:** `https://chatgpt.com/connector/oauth/*`, `https://chatgpt.com/connector_platform_oauth_redirect`, and `https://chatgpt.com/api/aip/p/oauth/callback`.
